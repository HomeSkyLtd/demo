# Rainfall demonstration repository
This repository contains sample code based on the Rainfall library and proposed assemblies using the Raspberry Pi for demonstration purposes

## Structure and How to use
The code in this repository is organized in three folders, each of which simulating a room in a house with a few sensors and actuators. For information on how to assembly each device on a Raspberry Pi and run the code, please refer to the documentation within the respective room's folder.

## Dependencies
This demo requires node.js installed in the target Raspberry Pi. Moreover, each folder has a proper package.json file listing the required dependencies for running the code referenced in the documentation. Before running any code, please run `npm install` in the target folder to fetch them from npm.
